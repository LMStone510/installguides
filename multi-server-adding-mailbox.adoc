= Adding a Mailbox Server to a Single Server Configuration

In the {product-name} ({product-abbrev}) single server environment, the LDAP, MTA, and mailbox services are on one machine.
This chapter explains how to add a new machine that is configured as a mailbox server to a single server configuration and how to remove the mailbox server from the single server node.

== Setup Requirements For Adding a Mailbox Server

* The new machine you are adding must have the same operating system, including the latest version and patch levels, as installed on the single server.
* The system clock must be configured with the same time on both machines.
* You must install the same version of the {product-abbrev} software that is installed on the single server node.
* A copy of the {product-abbrev} license needs to be added to a directory on the new machine.
* You are adding {product-short} Proxy to {product-abbrev}, this should be installed on the existing single-server before you set up the new mailbox server. See <<_installing_zimbra_proxy>>.


== Overview of Process

* {product-short} Mailbox Server is installed on the prepared machine.
* Customized configuration for the single-server, such as custom themes and Zimlets are added to the new mailbox server.
* Commercial SSL certificates are added to the new mailbox server.
* User accounts are moved from the single server to the new mailbox server.
* If you are moving all accounts from the single server, the mailbox server is stopped on the single server machine.


== Configuring the Mailbox Server

The host name and zmhostname configured on the mailbox server are the same as on the single server.

Make sure you know the LDAP master password as you configure it on the sever that is being added.
To find the master LDAP password on the single server node, type:

----
zmlocalconfig -s zimbra_ldap_password
----

NOTE: If you are installing the {product-short} proxy or _MTA_ on the new node, you will also need to record the following:

* Bind password for postfix ldap user
* Bind password for amavis ldap user
* Bind password for nginx ldap user
+

----
zmlocalconfig -s | grep -E '(amavis|nginx|postfix)_password'
----

IMPORTANT: Before you begin make sure you have an up-to-date backup!

. Follow steps 1 through 4 in <<starting_multiple_server_install>> to log on to the server as root and unpack the {product-short} software.
. Type `Y` for each package you are installing.
** Install `zimbra-store`, and `zimbra-spell` (optional) packages. When `zimbra-spell` is installed, the `zimbra-apache` package also is installed.
** If `zimbra-proxy` is configured, install `memcached`.
** The `zimbra-logger` package is installed only on one mailbox server.
If you are moving all mailboxes to this server from the original single server, install the `zimbra-logger` package.
** If _Archive and Discovery_ is installed on the single-server node, install `zimbra-archiving` on the new mailbox server.
+

NOTE: If SNMP is being used, type `Y` for `zimbra-snmp`. If SNMP is used, it is installed on every {product-short} server.

. Type `Y`, and press _Enter_ to modify the system. The selected packages are installed on the server.
+

NOTE: The _Main_ menu displays the default entries for the {product-short} component you are installing.

. Type `1` and press _Enter_ to go to the *Common Configuration* menu.
+

NOTE: The mailbox server hostname is displayed. You must change the LDAP master host name and password to be the values configured on the single- server node.

** Type `2`, press _Enter_, and type the LDAP host name.
** Type `4`, press _Enter_, and type the LDAP password.
+

NOTE: After you set these values, the server immediately contacts the LDAP server. If it cannot contact the server, you cannot proceed.

** Type `6` to set the correct time zone.
. Type `r` to return to the Main menu.
. From the Main menu, type `2` to go to the Store configuration menu.
** Type `2` to set **Create Admin User** to `No`.
** Type the corresponding number to set the SMTP host. This is the `mta-server` host name.
** Type the corresponding number if you want to change the default web server mode.
** If you are setting up IMAP/POP proxy servers, type the corresponding number to enable the servers.
** If the `zimbra-proxy` is used and is installed on another server, configure the following menu options
*** Configure for use with mail proxy
*** Configure to use with web proxy
+

NOTE: Set either or both of these to TRUE if you are going to set up `zimbra-proxy`.

** Type the corresponding menu number to install the {product-name} license file.
Enter the location of the license file. For example, if you saved the license file to the tmp directory, you would type `/tmp/ZCSLicense.xml`.
You cannot proceed without a license file.
** If you are setting up proxy servers, type the corresponding number to enable the servers. When you enable these, IMAP/POP/HTTP server port numbers and proxy port numbers are automatically changed. See <<_configuration_during_installation>>.
. When the mailbox server is configured, return to the Main menu and type a to apply the configuration changes. Press _Enter_ to save the configuration data.
. When *Save Configuration data to a file* appears, press _Enter_.
. The next request asks where to save the files. To accept the default, press _Enter_. To save the files to another directory, enter the directory and then press _Enter_.
. When *The system will be modified - continue?* appears, type `y` and press _Enter_.
+

NOTE: The server is modified. Installing all the components and configuring the mailbox server can take a few minutes. This includes installing SSL certificates, setting passwords, setting ports, installing skins and Zimlets, setting time zone preferences, and starting the servers, among other processes.
+
. When *Configuration complete - press return to exit* displays, press _Enter_.

The installation of the mailbox server is complete.

== Adding Customized Features

Any customizing of themes, or Zimlets, and any signed certificates stored on the single-server must be added to the new mailbox
server. See the {product-admin-guide} for information about adding the customized features.

== Testing the Configuration

To make sure that the new mail store server is correctly configured, create a new user on the new mailbox server and log into the account to verify that your configuration is correct. See <<_provisioning_accounts>>.

== Move Mailboxes

The command, `zmmboxmove`, is run to move user accounts from the mailbox server on the single-sever node to the new mailbox server.

You can set global options to exclude items from the mailbox move. See the {product-admin-guide} User Accounts chapter for more information about the mailbox move feature.

Move the following types of mailboxes:

* User accounts.
* Admin mailboxes. If you do not move the admin mailbox, you cannot log into the {product-name} Web Client.
* Spam and ham mailboxes.

NOTE: If you were using _Archive and Discovery_ on the single server mailbox, move the archival mailboxes as well.

=== Move Mailboxes Using CLI `zmmboxmove`

. To move a mailbox to a new server
+

----
zmmboxmove -a <email@address> --from <servername> --to <servername>
----

. To verify that the content of the mailbox was moved successfully, go to the administration console, select the account that was
moved. Click *View Mail* on the toolbar. When the account opens, verify that the accountâ€™s content is displayed and can be opened.
. Purge the mailbox from the old server:
+

----
zmpurgeoldmbox -a <email@address> -s <oldservername>
----

== Turn Off Mailbox Server on Single-Server Node

When all mailboxes have moved from the single-server node to the new mailbox server node, disable the Mailbox services on the original single-server machine.

. On the original single-server node, disable the following mailbox server components:
+

[cols=">10%,<90%"]
|====
|mailbox   |`zmprov -l ms <singleserver.com> +++--+++ -zimbraServiceEnabled mailbox`
|logger    |`zmprov -l ms <singleserver.com> +++--+++ -zimbraServiceEnabled logger`
|stats     |`zmprov -l ms <singleserver.com> +++--+++ -zimbraServiceEnabled stats`
|spell     |`zmprov -l ms <singleserver.com> +++--+++ -zimbraServiceEnabled spell`
|convertd  |`zmprov -l ms <singleserver.com> +++--+++ -zimbraServiceEnabled convertd`
|====

** If archiving was installed, disable it as well:
+

----
zmprov -l ms <singleserver.com> -- -zimbraServiceEnabled archiving
----

[start=2]
. After the mailbox services are disabled, verify that antispam, antivirus, ldap, mta, snmp, proxy, and memcached are the only services on the original single-server node.
+

----
zmprov -l gs <singleserver.com> | grep -i serviceenabled
----
