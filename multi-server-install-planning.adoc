== Configuration Examples

{product-name} can be easily scaled for any size of email environment, from very
small businesses with fewer than 25 email accounts to large businesses
with thousands of email accounts. Contact Zimbra Sales for more
information about setting up your environment.

== Overview of the Zimbra Proxy Server

{product-short} Proxy (Nginx-Zimbra) is a high-performance reverse proxy server
that passes **IMAP[S]/POP[S]/HTTP[S]** client requests to other internal
{product-name} services.  A reverse proxy server is an Internet-facing server
that protects and manages client connections to your internal services.  It
can also provide functions like: GSSAPI authentication, throttle
control, SSL connection with different certificates for different
virtual host names, and other features.

In a typical use case, {product-short} Proxy extracts user login information
(such as account id or user name) and then fetches the route to the
upstream mail server or web server's address from the **Nginx Lookup
Extension**, and finally proxies the interactions between clients and
upstream {product-name} servers.  To accelerate the speed of route lookup,
memcached is introduced, which caches the lookup result.  The subsequent login
with the same username is directly proxied without looking up in Nginx Lookup
Extension.

You can install the {product-short} Proxy package on a mailbox server, MTA
server, or on its own independent server.  When the {product-short} Proxy package
is installed, the proxy feature is enabled.  In most cases, no
modification is necessary.

Benefits for using the {product-short} Proxy include:

* Centralizes access to Mailbox servers
* Load Balancing
* Security
* Authentication
* SSL Termination
* Caching
* Centralized Logging and Auditing
* URLRewriting

=== {product-short} Proxy Components and Memcached

{product-short} Proxy is designed to provide a HTTP[S]/POP[S]/IMAP[S] reverse
proxy that is quick, reliable, and scalable. {product-short} Proxy includes the
following:

* **Nginx**. A high performance HTTP[S]/POP[S]/IMAP[S] proxy server which
  handles all incoming HTTP[S]/POP[S]/IMAP[S] requests.
* **{product-short} Proxy Route Lookup Handler**. This is a servlet (also named as
  Nginx Lookup Extension or NLE) located on the {product-name} mailbox server.
  This servlet handles queries for the user account route information
  (the server and port number where the user account resides).

**Memcached** is a high performance, distributed memory object caching system.
Route information is cached for further use to increase performance.
**zimbra-memcached** is a separate package that is recommended to be
installed along with zimbra-proxy.

=== {product-short} Proxy Architecture and Flow

The following sequence explains the architecture and the login flow when an
end client connects to {product-short} Proxy.

1. End clients connect to {product-short} Proxy using HTTP[S]/POP[S]/IMAP[S] ports.

2. Proxy attempts to contact a memcached server (elected from the available
   memcached servers, using a round-robin algorithm) if available and with
   caching enabled to query the upstream route information for this
   particular client.

3. If the route information is present in memcached, then this will be a
   **cache-hit** case and the proxy connects to the corresponding Zimbra
   Mailbox server right away and initiates a web/mail proxy session for
   this client. The memcached component stores the route information for
   the configured period of time (configurable and one hour by default).
   {product-short} proxy uses this route information instead of querying the Zimbra
   Proxy Route Lookup Handler/NLE until the default period of time has
   expired.

4. If the route information is not present in memcached, then this will be
   a **cache-miss** case, so {product-short} Proxy will proceed sending an HTTP request
   to an available {product-short} Proxy Route Lookup Handler/NLE (elected by
   round-robin), to look up the upstream mailbox server where this user
   account resides.

5. {product-short} Proxy Route Lookup Handler/NLE locates the route information from
   LDAP for the account being accessed and returns this back to {product-short} Proxy.

6. {product-short} Proxy uses this route information to connect to the
   corresponding {product-short} Mailbox server and initiates a web/mail proxy
   session. It also caches this route information into a memcached server
   so that the next time this user logs in, the memcached server has the
   upstream information available in its cache, and {product-short} Proxy will not
   need to contact NLE.The end client is transparent to this and behaves as
   if it is connecting directly to the {product-short} Mailbox server.

=== {product-short} Proxy Position in {product-name} Runtime

The following figure displays the positions of {product-short} Proxy and its
relationships to other components of {product-name}.

=== Deployment Strategy

The deployment strategy and position with respect to non-proxy hosts,
{product-short} actively suggests using the Proxy server on the edge (either on
an independent server or on the same server running LDAP/MTA) with
mailbox servers behind it. In the case of multiple proxies, an external
load balancer can be placed in front to distribute the load evenly among
the proxy servers.

[NOTE]
The {product-short} Proxy package does not act as a firewall and needs to be behind
the firewall in customer deployments.

=== Configuration during installation

zimbra-proxy package needs to be selected during the installation
process (it is installed by default). It is highly recommended to
install memcached as well along with proxy for better performance.

....
Install zimbra-proxy [Y]
Install zimbra-memcached [Y]
....

This would install and enable all IMAP[S]/POP[S]/HTTP[S] proxy
components with the following default configuration.

....
    Proxy configuration

       1) Status:                                  Enabled
       2) Enable POP/IMAP Proxy:                   TRUE
       3) IMAP proxy port:                         143
       4) IMAP SSL proxy port:                     993
       5) POP proxy port:                          110
       6) POP SSL proxy port:                      995
       7) Bind password for nginx ldap user:       set
       8) Enable HTTP[S] Proxy:                    TRUE
       9) HTTP proxy port:                         80
      10) HTTPS proxy port:                        443
      11) Proxy server mode:                       https
....

=== {product-short} Proxy Ports

[NOTE]
The following ports are used either by {product-short} Proxy or by {product-short} Mailbox
(if Proxy is not configured). +
**If you have any other services running on these ports, turn them off.**

End clients connect directly to {product-short} Proxy, using the {product-short} Proxy
Ports. {product-short} Proxy connects to the Route Lookup Handler/NLE (which
resides on {product-short} Mailbox server) using the {product-short} Mailbox Ports.

== Configuring for Virtual Hosting

You can configure multiple virtual hostnames to host more than one
domain name on a server. When you create a virtual host, users can log
in without having to specify the domain name as part of their user name.

Virtual hosts are configured from the administration console +
*Configure>Domains>Virtual Hosts* +
page. The virtual host requires a valid DNS configuration with an A record.

When users log in, they enter the virtual host name in the browser. For
example, **https://mail.example.com**. When the {product-short} logon screen
displays, users enter only their user name and password. The
authentication request searches for a domain with that virtual host
name. When the virtual host is found, the authentication is completed
against that domain.
