**Important:** You cannot have any other web server, database, _LDAP_,
or _MTA_ server running, when you install {product-name}. If you have
installed any of those applications before you install {product-short}
software, disable them.  During {product-name} installation,
{product-short} makes global system changes that may break
applications that are on your server.
